        <h3> Kevin Powell's youtube channel has been helpful for more than just making this website. As they have helped me understand and learn more about the basics of CSS and has helped me get a better understanding as a whole.</h3>

        <h3> Web Dev Simplified has helped me with JavaScript however I haven't learned the same amount as I did with Kevin. JavaScript is still too advanced for me as a whole and I feel it is going to take me longer to become proficient in it. Althought it is going to be a struggle I do not plan to stop trying to learn it anytime soon.</h3>

        <h3>
          This video was the hardest one for me to follow along too, however I believe that is because there is no voiceover to help explain anything. Without the voiceover or any explanations though I had to learn how things worked through trial and error and although I still do not know everything, I feel like I have a good grip on how the sidebar works and it was definetly a different way for me to try and learn.
