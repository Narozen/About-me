       <h1> Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          I am Christopher. I am currently learning about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have tried coding a few times but I always struggled to get deep into it or atleast well enough off to feel comfortable considering it to be a skill of mine. However thanks to TKH I have been able to learn at a much quicker rate and That has helped me create the website currently in front of you. </p>
      <h2> Hobbies</h2>
     <p> One of my favorite hobbies is art. I have been working both traditionally and through graphic design to make create some pieces that I enjoy. One of which was even entered into a t-shirt competition that was held locally and I was able to win. I haven't drawn as much in the recent years however sadly, but I still love to do it all the same.</p>

    </div>
     <p> I also love to play video games while talking to my friends which has lead me to wanna learn how to make games in the future if not for a career then just to satiate my curiosity. My love for games stems from me playing with my older brother as a kid, we would always play fps games together, mainly it was against eachother. Recently I have been branching out into a new genre of games and it has been fun experimenting with my friends and I hope to be able to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
     <h2> Pets </h2>
     <p> Currently there are two different pets residing within this household. I have one cat named Lily who is chaotic and loves to play with paper reciepts. As well as a frog named Platy who mainly vibes in his terrarium.
